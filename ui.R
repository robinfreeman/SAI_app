It therefore consists of time series of varying lengths (interval between the first and the last observation) and fullness (number of observations over the total number of years) For some species/groups, however, only shorter time-series are available, as shown in Figure 7. Whilst time series for birds and mammals appear to be longer, amphibians are almost exclusively represented in the database by shorter time-series. Collecting and using only long-term data, which are often available for species/groups that are doing better on the whole, we could potentially miss declines in other species, which are important signals from a conservation perspective. Also, a recent study comparing known long-term trends in bird abundance with samples of these complete time series (Wauchope et al. 2019) suggests that if a significant trend is detected by the sample it is likely to reliably describe the direction (positive or negative) of the complete trend. Although it remains to be tested if these results can be expanded to other taxonomic groups and types of data, this might suggest that a decline detected in a short time series is worth investigating to confirm the trend and potentially avoid further decline."),

Trends calculated excluding time-series with less than 5 and 10 years of data diverge from the global trend from 2002 and 2003, respectively.
